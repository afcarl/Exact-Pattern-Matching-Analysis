Exact Pattern Matching Analysis
===============================

## Description

KAUST CS260 course project.
In this project we analyse and compare performances of the following three exact pattern matching algorithms:

1. Boyer-Moore algorithm
2. Aho-Corasick algorithm
3. Suffix tree based algorithm

## TODO:
* Theoretically analyse each of the algorithms:
  - ~~Understand and write up thorough algorithm descriptions~~
  - ~~prove the correctness of each of the algorithms~~
  - ~~estimate algorithm time and space complexities in the worst case, in an average case (amortized time cost)~~
  - ~~create the midway presentation (by Oct 20)~~
  - ~~create the midway report (by Oct 31)~~
* Finally, confirm the datasets we are working with [**deadline: November 18**].
* Write simple tests. We need about 5-10 different simple tests to make sure that our implementations work as they are expected. [**deadline: November 22**]
* Implement each of the algorithms in C/C++. [**deadline: November 24**]
* Measure performances of the algorithms on the test sets under exactly the same conditions for each of the algorithms (on the same machine). [**deadline: November 27-28**]
* Plot the graphs and write up the final analysys. [**deadline: November 28-29**]
* Create presentation slides for delivering our results. [**deadline: December 1**]
* Write up the final report. [**deadline: November December 4**]
