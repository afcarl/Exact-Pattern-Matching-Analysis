Exact Pattern Matching Analysis
===============================

## Description

KAUST CS260 course project.
In this project we analyse and compare performances of the most sophisticated exact pattern matching algorithms known up today:

1. Boyer-Moore algorithm
2. Aho-Corasick algorithm
3. Suffix tree based algorithm

## TODO:
* Theoretically analyse each of the algorithms:
  - understand and write up thorough algorithm descriptions
  - prove correctness of each of the algorithms
  - estimate algorithm time and space complexities in the worst case, in an average case (amortized)
* Write simple tests. We need about 5-10 different simple tests to make sure that our implementations pass these tests.
* Implenet each of the algorithms in C/C++.
* Measure performance of each of the algorithms on the test sets under exactly the same conditions for each of the algorithms.
* Plot the graphs and write up the final analysys.
* Create presentation slides for delivering our results.
